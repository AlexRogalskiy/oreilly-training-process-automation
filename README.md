# Training "Process Automation in Modern Architectures"


## Lab 1: Execute Your First BPMN Process

You have three options to do this lab, depending on your level of interest:

1. Install Camunda locally: This needs a Java runtime, do this if you are fluent in Java and love to fully understand what you are doing and play around with the environment afterwards.
2. Leverage a managed Camunda instance: This will require you to code in Java, NodeJS or C#. Do this if you want to get your hands dirty at least a bit, but rely on a prepared environment to keep things simple.
3. Watch the recording: If you want to skip doing something yourself, you can watch a simple walk through
